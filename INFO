Pull Code from GitHub: Jenkins clones or fetches the latest code from the GitHub repository into its workspace (/var/lib/jenkins/workspace/<job_name>).

Execute Build Steps: If it's a Java project, Jenkins compiles it. If it's a simple HTML page, Jenkins just copies the files.

Deployment:

If it's a static website (HTML, CSS, JS), Jenkins copies files to /var/www/html/ (for Apache).

If it's a web application (WAR file), Jenkins moves it to Tomcatâ€™s webapps/ folder.

Permissions & Restart: Jenkins updates file permissions and restarts the required service (Apache or Tomcat).

So, Jenkins never directly modifies files in production locations. It copies them from its workspace to the right place.
